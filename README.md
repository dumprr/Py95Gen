# Py95Gen

 Windows 95 Key Generator - but in Python now!

## Usage

There are 2 versions: The fully console version and the Window version.

The fully console version is self explanatory; it runs in the console and outputs in the console.

However, the Window version uses `tkinter` to create a windowed experience for the user, with a button and output box.
